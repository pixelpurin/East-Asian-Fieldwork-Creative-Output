    <h2><strong>♡ Reclaiming Femininity & Escaping Reality in Harajuku ♡</strong></h2>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div id="box">
      <p>Harajuku has historically been seen as the central fashion hub of Tokyo, filled with unique style and providing people with the inspiration to express themselves through their appearance, as well as serving as a form of escape from everyday society and typical conventions.</p>
      <p>FRUiTs Magazine is a publication <a href="https://somethingcurated.com/2020/03/31/how-fruits-magazine-embedded-harajuku-fashion-into-the-worlds-consciousness/" target=_blank>often credited</a> with debuting Harajuku’s unique fashion culture to the rest of the world. Since its creation in 1997, it has documented street fashion. Despite its previous closure in 2017, with creator Shoichi Aoki declaring that there were <a href="https://www.fashionsnap.com/article/2017-02-03/fruits-stop/" target=_blank>‘no more cool kids to photograph’</a>, it has <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/59816/1/street-style-mag-fruits-returns-shoichi-aoki-english-translation-harajuku-cult" target=_blank>returned to publication this year</a> – signifying that fashion’s popularity is returning to Harajuku and the period of stagnation is over. Despite magazines and publications previously being credited with having put a pin in Harajuku on the globe in terms of fashion, trends have changed a lot since then. Nowadays, it seems that the vast majority of trends both originate and spread online.</p>
      <p>Many alternative subcultures exist which originated in Japan: from yume kawaii and fairy kei’s pastel overload, to visual kei’s dramatic glam rock-inspired style.</p>
      <p>Despite their difference in looks, these fashion subcultures share many similarities. Firstly, there is a feeling of belonging within each. Those who wear the style of a subculture often do so in order to indicate that they have interests in common with the others who wear it, or even similar personality type. As well as this, through self-expression from the inside to the outside, it allows the participants to have some form of escapism from everyday society and their troubles. Another commonality is that many fashion subcultures have an element of ‘collecting’ items to wear, such as many accessories and different items of clothing which can be placed together to create a visually appealing assemblage. Members of various subcultures describe a <a href="https://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/2926" target=_blank>‘tokimeki’</a> feeling when finding a perfect piece – literally, a heart-fluttering feeling.</p>
      <p>Amongst the many alternative subcultures existing and originating in Tokyo, girly, cute and feminine styles have been popular for a long time – particularly because of <em>kawaii</em> culture. As far as researchers can tell, the <em>kawaii</em> craze began in the late 1960s to early 1970s – although it picked up a  lot later in <em>kawaii</em> fashion, with early trends such as lolita fashion featuring plentiful cute motifs and over the top amount of frills and ribbons. Plus - what other country has officially <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/press/2009/3/0312.html" target=_blank>designated ‘kawaii taishi’</a> (ambassadors of cuteness) – three models who appear in official capacity at Japanese global events to promote the image of Japan’s cute culture?</p>
      <p>However, this cute mask can often hide a darker image beneath. It has been suggested that cuteness is used as sort of a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/younker/files/lolita_-_dreaming_despairing_defying.pdf" target=_blank>cultural Prozac</a> in Japan’s brutally rigid society, and used to escape personal troubles and temporarily forget these things through cute self-expression.</p>
      <p>A few of the cute fashion subcultures worn by girls in Harajuku will be discussed, including their origins, how to spot them, and what being a part of the subculture means to its members.</p>

    <p>Girly-kei fashion (meaning ‘girly type fashion’) is a term used to describe the current trend of hyper-feminine fashion, featuring ribbons, lace and frills.</p>
    <p>This alternative fashion subculture seems to have experienced a recent surge in popularity. Walking around Harajuku, I spotted it many times– and many popular clothing stores I entered contained this style, including La Foret’s axes femme, Ank Rouge and Liz Lisa. Takeshita Street also featured shops selling this style, Noemie being a noticeably large shop selling only this.</p>
    <p>Girly-kei fashion is considered by some to be a casual form of lolita fashion, as they share many similarities – from the ribbons, lace and frills to many accessories, skirts, dresses and platform or heeled shoes.</p>
    <p>There are two most noticeable sides to this fashion subculture. These are most commonly referred to as ‘ryousangata’ (literally meaning ‘mass produced’, referring to fast fashion trends that are currently popular and cause everyone to look the same) and ‘jirai kei’ (meaning ‘landmine girl’) fashion.</p>
    <p>These two trends are notably referred to with derogatory terms towards the young women who choose to dress this way. However, there are many whom choose to keep these terms to refer to themselves in a way to reclaim the stereotype.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="Ryousangata"></div>
    <div id="box">
      <h3>Ryousangata (量産型)</h3>
    <h4>Brief History & Description:</h4>
    <p>The term ‘ryousangata’ originated in a 2013 article, in which the author commented on how all female university students seemed to dress the same nowadays. It is often used as a way for onlookers to look down upon young women. It can be seen as vain for girls to be primarily interested in makeup, looks, and fashion – despite them also being looked down upon if they do not live up to the beauty standard. There seems no way to win. However, ryousangata fashion followers hope to reclaim the term, and show that there is no shame in loving fashion and expressing yourself through your looks. It is often used a hashtag by followers of ryousangata fashion, and girls gather together with the same interests: often, ryousangata fashion is associated with idol fans, otaku, and so on. Instead of being dragged down by the negative terms used to refer to them, these girls choose to embrace it. Furthermore – despite this style being referred to as being just like every other girl, it is not the case at all, as most girls do not seem to wear this style, and when strolling around Harajuku, I noted this to be a small subculture. It was, however, perhaps the most popular subculture there at the time I visited.</p>
    <h4>How to spot it:</h4>
    <p>Ryousangata is ever-changing to follow current trends. Despite this, it always contains the same primary features.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Makeup:</li>
      <p>The emphasis of ryousangata style makeup is on delicate, doll-like features. This is done through pale makeup, blush and focus on enlarging the eyes with eyeshadow, particularly below the lower lids, and circle contact lenses.</p>
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/40/f8/72/40f872ee3ea4d770d11d1b3e0e672aa2.jpg" alt="Ryousangata style makeup tutorial" class=center width=250px height=250px>
      <li>Hair:</li>
      <p>Hair is often styled with ribbons, and features fluffy or hime bangs. It is often dyed – colours such as light brown, blonde and pink are popular. Curly hair or curled over ends are more popular choices than straight hair.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <li>Accessories:</li>
      <p>Nail extensions are very common – in fact, any time I noticed anyone wearing this style, it was not without painted nails adorned with jewels and ribbon charms. Sanrio characters My Melody and Kuromi are often incorporated into the outfits as well, such as keychains.</p>
      <li>Clothing:</li>
      <p>Ryousangata clothing is extremely feminine. It features blouses and skirts or dresses with plentiful ribbons, lace and frills, as well as collars, puff sleeves and high waists. The primary colour is dusty or pale pink, with secondary combinations of black, light grey or white. There is some variation, as I noted some blue pieces in stores also. Shoes are never flat – always platform or high heel and are worn with lace tights or knee / thigh-high socks. Even tote bags, handbags and rucksacks carried by ryousangata wearers are adorned with charms, jewels and ribbons.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>Escaping from reality and finding a community:</h4>
    <p>Subcultures such as ryousangata enable young girls to find their community and feel a sense of belonging. Whilst perhaps looked down upon by outsiders, criticising them for and all looking the same, trend-following and superficially being fixated on their looks, within the community, there is no such judgement and they can encourage each other to pursue their interests and can enjoy them together and embrace girlhood and its joys without being shamed.</p>

    <div id="box">
      <h3>Jirai-Kei (地雷系)</h3>
    <p>Amongst the most popular fashion subcultures I noted throughout my time in Tokyo was the ‘jirai-kei’ substyle. Despite its cute surface-level looks, this subculture has dark undertones.</p>
  <h4>Brief History & Description</h4>
    <p>Jirai-kei fashion is a mixture of the previous ‘yami kawaii’ (or ‘sick cute’) style topped off with ryousangata. Yami kawaii fashion became popular during 2015 as a way to express one’s mental health struggles through fashion. Despite mental illness being a taboo subject, this fashion serves as an outlet of emotions for many people who wear it, with common motifs combining cute and grotesque or dark messages. Jirai-kei fashion as a subculture mainly grew online thanks to social media, and saw the most growth around 2020.</p>
    <h4>How to spot it:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Makeup:</li>
    <p>Jirai-kei style makeup is distinctive, with pale foundation and dark under-eye makeup, almost appearing to be the shape of eye bags. The eyes are enlarged with eyeliner and circle contact lenses.</p>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/47/3b/c2/473bc2c8e2e2772b050dc73dc30ff720.jpg" alt="Jirai-kei style makeup tutorial" class=center width=250px height=250px>
    <li>Hair:</li>
    <p>Unlike the light or natural hair colours in ryousangata, jirai-kei fashion wearers typically opt for dark hair – a popular style being with bleached or dyed streaks. It also features straight-cut or hime bangs.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/45/5f/5b/455f5b85b87255f83f92ae56efb491ca.jpg" alt="Dark Hairstyle with white streaks" width="50%" height="50%">

        </div>
      </div>
    <li>Accessories:</li>
    <p>Once again, the mascots My Melody and Kuromi are popular – particularly this release. Black tote bags, handbags and backpacks are adorned with ribbons and gemstones. Black nail extensions featuring charms and ribbons are also popular. Unlike ryousangata, jirai-kei features piercings. Many ear piercings, rather than just lobe piercings, are popular, as well as facial and sometimes tongue piercings too.</p>
    <li>Clothing:</li>
    <p>As another hyper-feminine fashion style, jirai-kei fashion also features ribbons, lace and frills, puff sleeves and more high-waisted silhouettes. The primarily colour of the outfits is most commonly black, with either white or black accents. High heel platforms are worn with lace tights and high socks or fishnets.</p>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/94/93/529493d5829b168176b88487175cf6a1.jpg" alt="Examples of dark girly-kei fashion" width="40%" height="40%" class="center">
  <h4>Jirai-Kei: Self-Expression or Dangerous Romanticisation?</h4>
  <p>Despite its cutesy looks, jirai-kei has dark undertones. Even the name itself (translating to ‘landmine girl’) is a derogatory term (causing some amongst the community to debate the style’s name and seeing it as offensive) referring to a woman who is emotionally explosive despite being cute and sweet on the surface. The idea of a ‘jirai-onna’ is of a girl who easily breaks down emotionally and is often quick to become jealous and possessive over their partner (or even favourite idol). They are seen to have low self-esteem, and as a result often engage in harmful behaviours such as excessive alcohol consumption (as shown with many jirai-kei wearers posing with Strong Zero) and self-harm. These stereotypes can be seen by recent media, such as manga and video games, containing girls wearing this style and acting in this way.</p>
  <p>As with ryousangata girls, many jirai-kei fashion fans choose to reclaim this term used against them, as they see it as a misogynistic caricature and choose to instead accept the name.</p>
  <p>However – it is difficult to argue whether this is simply self-expression, or if it glamourising such behaviours and encouraging young girls to take part in them in order to fit in within the subculture, or otherwise encouraging other girls to continue these harmful behaviours rather than seek to recover. In my opinion, cute drawings featuring such harmful behaviours as self-injury, alcoholism or eating disorders do not represent the reality of the struggle behind these behaviours and romanticise the situation by simply portraying a cute and pretty girl who happens to have these traits.</p>

  <h3>A Co-Ord I picked up in Tokyo!</h3>
  <p>One of my aims when shopping in Tokyo was to pick up a girly-kei style coordinate. This super cute and hyper-feminine style is so unique to Japan, and so it was fascinating to see it in stores when it is something completely unlike everday fashion worn in The UK.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">

      <figcaption>Ribbon details - the ribbons have both clips and pins for your hair or for your outfit.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
      <br>
      <p>I combined pieces from multiple stores to create this coordinate: The shoes, bag and ribbons from Noemie on Takeshita Street, dress from Liz Lisa in Shibuya 109 and Shorts from Honey Cinnamon in Ikebukuro's Sunshine City. The original ribbon which came with the dress was pink, but I opted for a matching ribbon for my dress and for my hair - which also matches the shoes and bag as well. One thing I admire about Japanese <em>kawaii</em> fashion pieces is the level of detail and attention put into them. Even buckles and zips are heart-shaped, edges are lace trimmed, ribbon is added even when it may not be noticeable. There is a high level of dedication to making every aspect of the clothing look as cute as possible. As well as this, I love the customisability of it - the pieces are often like collectables, and putting them together in different ways, even just adjusting a few accessories, can give you the look of a whole new outfit.

    <div id="Lolita"></div>
    <div id="box">
      <h3>Lolita Fashion</h3>
      <h4>Brief History & Description:</h4>
    <p>Lolita fashion has been around far longer than the newer styles of girly kei fashion mentioned above, with its origins being traced back to the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/younker/files/lolita_-_dreaming_despairing_defying.pdf">1980s</a>. Much like ryousangata and jirai-kei, this fashion subculture is found almost exclusively in Japan, and originated in Harajuku. Unlike them, however, it is an umbrella which covers other, smaller sub-genres of fashion. It takes inspiration from Rococo and Victorian fashion. It contains primarily classic, gothic and sweet lolita (although my personal favourite is old school). The most popular brands include Angelic Pretty, Baby, The Stars Shine Bright, Metamorphose Temps de Fille, Alice and the Pirates, Moi-même-Moitié and more.</p>
    <p>Lolita fashion also comes with a set of rules, which most tend to follow. Despite being an alternative subculture, there is still a desire to 'fit in', in a way, only to fit into the subculture rather than wider society.</p>
    <h4>How to spot it:</h4>
    <h4>Hair:</h4>
    <p>Lolita fashion most commonly features big hair, large curls, waves and bangs. It is most commonly long or bob-cut, but many lolitas wear wigs.</p>
    <h4>Clothing:</h4>
    <p>With just one look at a lolita coordinate, you can see that it is inspired by Rococo and Victorian fashion, as mentioned above. They feature cupcake, a-line or bell-shaped skirts, noticeable by the petticoat providing extra volume worn by lolitas, which is usually just above the knee, at the knee or below. The outfits are covered in ribbons, frills and lace.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Petticoat</li>
      <p>The petticoat is an essential lolita item which provides volume to the skirt.</p>
      <li>Jumper Skirt (JSK)</li>
      <p>The JSK is a dress which does not cover the shoulders - therefore it is worn with a blouse, bolero or cardigan.</p>
      <li>One-Piece (OP)</li>
      <p>The OP is a dress with either short sleeves which cover the shoulder or long sleeves. It is worn with or without a blouse.</p>
      <li>Skirt</li>
      <p>Despite being less popular within the fashion compared to JSKs and OPs, skirts are a part of lolita fashion.</p>
      <li>Blouse</li>
      <p>Collared blouses are popular in lolita fashion.</p>
      <li>Outerwear</li>
      <p>Outerwear includes cardigans, boleros and coats. Lolita coats are often long and faux fur-lined.
      <li>Headwear</li>
      <p>Headwear covers bonnets, ribbons, hats or any other headpiece such as earmuffs. Headwear is essential to complete an outfit.</p>
      <li>Footwear</li>
      <p>Footwear includes socks, which are most commonly frilly over the knee (OTK) socks and shoes, which are most commonly mary janes. Lolita shoes are almost always high-heeled or platform.</p>
      <li>Accessories</li>
      <p>Lolita accessories include handbags, which are often heart-shaped and frilly, or the shape of the brand's mascot (such as the extremely popular Usakumya from Baby, The Stars Shine Bright). Gloves, or, more commonly wrist cuffs are also worn.</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
      <p>It may seem odd for an 'alternative subculture' to have so many rules, and some do debate why there must be so many. However, most lolitas who choose to follow the fashion enjoy them, and find it more fun to find pieces to fit into each category and fill out the outfit.</p>
      <h4>Lolita Escapism</h4>
      <p>In an article I read recently, I found a quote which perfectly encasulates the appeal of lolita for many. According to Teresa Younker’s article, ‘As it exists in Japan, Lolita Fashion, like other Japanese subcultures, developed as a response to social pressures and anxieties felt by young women and men in the 1970s and 1980s. Rather than dealing with the difficult reality of rapid commercialization, destabilization of society, a rigid social system, and an increasingly body-focused fashion norm, a select group of youth chose to find comfort in the over-the-top imaginary world of lace, frills, bows, tulle, and ribbons that is Lolita Fashion. However, the more gothic elements of the style reflect that behind this cute façade lurks the dark, sinister knowledge that this ploy will inevitably end, the real world unchanged.’</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="box">
    <h3>A Co-Ord I added to in Tokyo!</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, lolita stores in Japan do not allow photography - but they exceeded expectations and I had so much fun visiting them. Once again, it is something which simply cannot be found at home in The United Kingdom. Our Western version or image of lolita fashion is often far removed from the original Harajuku-born subculture.</p>

      <figcaption>Adjusted the coordinate for cold weather.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
    <p>This is an old school-style lolita coordinate I put together. The headpiece is a recent addition which I picked up in Harajuku's Baby, The Stars Shine Bright from their recent gingham collection. It was something I was excited to find, as I was seeking an item to pair with the gingham OP shown here (Lovely Cherry March OP also by Baby, The Stars Shine Bright). I topped this with Baby's Heart Apron and their knee socks. The only items from other brands are the Demonia shoes, which, despite not being lolita-branded are popular amongst the Western lolita community, and the Angelic Pretty bag. From the images it is clearly an <s>old</s> well-loved piece I own. I chose to pair these pieces to create a black and white look with gingham highlights and a heart motif. For cold days, the headpiece may be replaced with Baby, The Stars Shine Bright rabbit earmuffs and a rabbit ear cape from Angelic Pretty to change the heart motif into a rabbit theme.</p>
    <p>Once again, an aspect I admire about lolita fashion is the attention to detail. The lace always has different cute details, such as heart, ribbon or flower shape and there are hidden ribbons and tiny details everywhere.</p>
